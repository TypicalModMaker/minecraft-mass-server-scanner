# Minecraft Mass Server Scanner
Minecraft mass server scanner using python, massscan and QuboScanner.
# Idea taken from LiveOverflow (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIy_YbfAKqo)

## :warning: **RUNNING THIS ON YOUR MAIN MACHINE (PC) IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, Quoting massscan:**

> Scanning the entire Internet is bad. For one thing, parts of the Internet react badly to being scanned. For another thing, some sites track scans and add you to a ban 
list, which will get you firewalled from useful parts of the Internet.


# How to run it:
1. Edit config.json and put your mongoDB details there, ports you wish to scan and the IP range.

2. Install requirements.
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run main.py
```
python main.py
```
